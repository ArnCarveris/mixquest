MixQuest
========

MixQuest is a game-like demo and, alas, is not an actual playable game (yet).

## Demo

The project gives a real-world example for the following:

* [DynaMix](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix) - A dynamic type composition, OOP, and polymorphism library.

## Setup instructions

There are submodules in this repo. Don't forget to call `git clone --recursive` or `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`

*...more to come*
